// Command wirecheck asserts wire-protocol compatibility between the Go
// server half (the web-terminal-engine module go.mod pins) and the served
// TS client half (the Dockerfile-ARG-pinned npm artifact). The two halves are
// pinned INDEPENDENTLY — Renovate moves the Go module and the npm ARGs in
// separate PRs, and a Go-only engine release publishes no npm package at all —
// so nothing but this gate proves the pair the image ships is one the engine
// considers compatible.
//
// The compatibility RULE is the engine's (terminal.WirePairIncompatibility —
// the same verdict its runtime handshake reaches, so this gate can never
// disagree with the close-4002 refusal). This program supplies the Go side
// from the engine's public constants; the client side arrives as flags the
// Dockerfile's wire-floor gate extracts from the vendored artifact.
//
// Without the gate a declared-incompatible pairing builds green, deploys,
// answers /healthz healthy, and then refuses every session at first connect
// with close code 4002 — an outage that looks like a healthy container. Fail
// the build instead.
//
// Exit 0: the pairing is declared-compatible. Exit 1: a declared floor is
// violated. Exit 2: usage error (a missing, malformed, or non-positive
// -client-rev / -client-min-server flag).
